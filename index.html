          <p>The Sapporo Snow Festival (さっぽろ雪まつり, Sapporo Yuki Matsuri) is held during one week every February in Hokkaido's capital
            Sapporo. It is one of Japan's most popular winter events.
            
            The Sapporo Snow Festival was started in 1950, when high school students built a few snow statues in Odori Park. It has
            since developed into a large, commercialized event, featuring spectacular snow and ice sculptures and attracting more
            than two million visitors from Japan and across the world.
            
            The snow festival is staged on three sites: the Odori Site, Susukino Site and Tsu Dome Site.</p>

            The market's shops cater to both locals and tourists alike, and have a good selection at reasonable prices. Like other
            seafood markets around Japan, an excellent way to experience the market's offerings is to have a meal of fresh local
            seafood served over rice (domburi) at one of the local restaurants.</p>

          <p>Fort Goryokaku (五稜郭, Goryōkaku) is a massive, star shaped, Western style citadel, which was built in the last years of
          the Edo Period for the defense of Hakodate against the imperialist threat posed by the Western powers. A few years
          later, the fort became the site of a civil war between an army of the shogunate and the superior troops of the newly
          established Meiji government.
          
          After the fort had lost its military importance, it was eventually turned into a public park in the 1910s. Over one
          thousand cherry trees were planted along its moats, making it one of Hokkaido's best cherry blossom spots. The peak of
          the blooming season usually takes place around early May.</p>

          <p>The Kanto Matsuri (竿燈まつり, "pole lantern festival") is a Tanabata related celebration in Akita City, held every year from
          August 3 to 6. The highlight of the festival is an impressive display of skill in which performers balance kanto (long
          bamboo poles) with arrays of paper lanterns attached to the end. The Kanto Matsuri together with Aomori's Nebuta
          Festival and Sendai's Tanabata makes up the three great festivals of the Tohoku Region.
          
          The kanto poles come in different sizes with the largest measuring 12 meters, weighing 50 kilograms and carrying as many
          as 46 paper lanterns, lit by real candles. To the sound of drums, flutes and onlookers chanting "dokkoisho, dokkoisho",
          each kanto is hoisted up by a single performer who balance them on end using various techniques. The performers change
          every few minutes and gradually add extensions to the pole until the kanto are at their maximum height.</p>

          Apart from the loss of its castle, Kakunodate remains remarkably unchanged since its founding in 1620. The town was
          built with two distinct areas, the samurai district and the merchant district. Once home to 80 families, the samurai
          district still has some of the best examples of samurai architecture in all of Japan.
          
          Kakunodate is also well known as the location of one of the Tohoku Region's most popular cherry blossom spots. Around
          late April and early May, large crowds of people come to see Kakunodate's special combination of pink blossoms and
          historic homes.</p>

          <img src='./src/Images/nebutamatsuri.jpg'>
          <p>Nebuta and Neputa are a type of Tanabata related summer festival held in towns around Aomori Prefecture. The largest of
          these festivals is the Nebuta Matsuri (ねぶた祭) of Aomori City, held every year from August 2 to 7. The highlight of the
          festival is the daily parade of enormous lantern floats, flanked by large taiko drums, musicians and dancers. The Nebuta
          Matsuri together with Akita's Kanto Matsuri and Sendai's Tanabata make up the Tohoku Sandai Matsuri (Three Great
          Festivals of the Tohoku Region).
          
          Local teams build the festival's two dozen floats, which are constructed of painted washi paper over a wire frame and
          take an entire year to design and construct. They can be up to nine meters wide and five meters tall and often depict
          gods, historical or mythical figures from both Japanese and Chinese culture, kabuki actors, and characters from the
          popular NHK Taiga Drama historical TV series.</p>

          <img src='./src/Images/aomori_shirakami_sanchi.jpg'>
          <p>Shirakami Sanchi (白神山地) is an extensive mountain range straddling the border between Aomori and Akita prefectures in the
          northern Tohoku Region of Japan. The central core of Shirakami Sanchi is made up of the last virgin beech forests in
          Japan, for which the region was declared one of the country's first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1993.

          One popular destination are the Juniko ("twelve lakes"), a series of small lakes and ponds connected by hiking
          trails, on the north western side of Shirakami Sanchi along the coast of the Sea of Japan. The area offers scenic day
          hiking, fishing, boating and camping around its lakes and ponds, one of which, Aoike, has enchanted looking, almost
          unnaturally blue water. There is also a small visitor center, the Juniko Eco-Museum Center Kokyokan, that explains about
          the area's beech forests.

          <p>During the Edo Period, Hirosaki (弘前) was the political and cultural capital of the Tsugaru Region, the western section
          of present day Aomori Prefecture. The city remains one of the culturally richest cities in the northern Tohoku Region.
          
          Hirosaki developed around its castle, Hirosaki Castle. Several thousand cherry trees are planted around the castle
          grounds, which become one of Japan's most spectacular cherry blossom spots typically from late April to early May.

          <h1>Gyutan</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/sendai-gyutan.jpg'>
          <p>Sendai is the original home of gyutan (牛タン, gyūtan), a dish consisting of pieces of thinly sliced beef tongue, cooked
          over a charcoal grill. Besides the standard version of grilled tongue and pickled vegetables seen above, gyutan is also
          popular in donburi form, as a curry, or in a beef stew.
          
          The dish originated fairly recently in 1948 when a yakitori restaurant owner in Sendai devoted his business to the
          preparation of beef tongue dishes. It has grown rapidly in popularity and spread throughout Japan.
          
          Common side dishes of gyutan are oxtail soup, and mugi gohan (steamed white rice with barley). In its donburi variety,
          gyutan is served over a bowl of steamed white rice, while the curry gyutan is accompanied by rice as well.
          
          The two most popular gyutan restaurant chains are Rikyu and Kisuke. Both of these chains have branches on Gyutan Dori
          (gyutan street) on third floor of Sendai Station. The restaurants of Gyutan Dori open their doors at 10:00 while most of
          the city branch gyutan chains open for lunch around 11:00. Menus generally range in price from about 1000 yen to about
          2000 yen.</p>

          <h1>Sendai Tanabata Matsuri</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/sendai-tanabata.jpg'>
          <p>Tanabata festivals, also known as "star festivals", are held across Japan on the 7th day of the 7th month of the year,
          when, according to Chinese legend, the two stars Altair and Vega cross paths. Due to differences between the lunar
          calendar and the solar calendar, modern tanabata festivals take place either in July or August.
          
          The Sendai Tanabata Matsuri (仙台七夕まつり), held every year on August 6-8, is one of the largest and most famous tanabata
          celebrations in Japan. Together, with Akita's Kanto Matsuri and Aomori's Nebuta Matsuri, it makes up the Tohoku Sandai
          Matsuri (Three Great Festivals of the Tohoku Region).
          
          While festivities take place throughout Downtown Sendai, the festival's main feature are thousands of colorful streamers
          that decorate the city's shopping arcades, which come to resemble brightly colored forests. Each set of 3-5 meter long
          streamers is handcrafted by local shops, schools and community groups out of washi paper and bamboo. They are then hung
          from ten meter long bamboo poles along the arcades.</p>

          <p>Zuihoden (瑞鳳殿, Zuihōden) is the mausoleum of Date Masamune, one of the most powerful feudal lords of the Edo Period.
          Masamune was the first in a long line of Date lords to rule over Sendai from Aoba Castle. His son and grandson, Date
          Tadamune and Date Tsunamune, are entombed in nearby mausoleums, while other descendants are laid to rest in less
          elaborate graves and tombs.
          
          Zuihoden was designed in the ornate style of the Momoyama Period. It features intricate woodwork and a rich variety of
          vivid colors. Masamune's son and grandson are entombed in smaller mausoleums designed in the same style.
          Massive cedar trees surround the paths in the area, and are meant to symbolize the long history of the Date clan.</p>

          Tokyo Skytree Town in the Sumida City Ward, not far away from Asakusa. With a height of 634 meters (634 can be read as
          "Musashi", a historic name of the Tokyo Region), it is the tallest structure in Japan and the second tallest in the
          world at the time of its completion. A large shopping complex with aquarium is located at its base.
        
          The highlight of the Tokyo Skytree is its two observation decks which offer spectacular views out over Tokyo. The two
          enclosed decks are located at heights of 350 and 450 meters respectively, making them the highest observation decks in
          Japan and some of the highest in the world.</p>
