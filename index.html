          <p>The Sapporo Snow Festival (さっぽろ雪まつり, Sapporo Yuki Matsuri) is held during one week every February in Hokkaido's capital
            Sapporo. It is one of Japan's most popular winter events.
            
            The Sapporo Snow Festival was started in 1950, when high school students built a few snow statues in Odori Park. It has
            since developed into a large, commercialized event, featuring spectacular snow and ice sculptures and attracting more
            than two million visitors from Japan and across the world.
            
            The snow festival is staged on three sites: the Odori Site, Susukino Site and Tsu Dome Site.</p>

            just outside of Sapporo's Central Wholesale Market. One of the city's largest public markets, the Curb Market
            specializes in Hokkaido seafood such as crab, sea urchin, salmon roe, squid and scallops, and local produce such as
            corn, melons and potatoes when in season.
            
            The market's shops cater to both locals and tourists alike, and have a good selection at reasonable prices. Like other
            seafood markets around Japan, an excellent way to experience the market's offerings is to have a meal of fresh local
            seafood served over rice (domburi) at one of the local restaurants.</p>

          The small village consists of only about a dozen buildings, wooden lodges, a beautiful youth hostel and two or three
          large hotels. Shopping and dining opportunities are limited to the hotels and the ropeway station. For weather

            Hokkaido's development was carried out on a large scale. There are four different sections: a town, fishing village,

          <p>Fort Goryokaku (五稜郭, Goryōkaku) is a massive, star shaped, Western style citadel, which was built in the last years of
            the Edo Period for the defense of Hakodate against the imperialist threat posed by the Western powers. A few years
            later, the fort became the site of a civil war between an army of the shogunate and the superior troops of the newly
            established Meiji government.
            
            After the fort had lost its military importance, it was eventually turned into a public park in the 1910s. Over one
            thousand cherry trees were planted along its moats, making it one of Hokkaido's best cherry blossom spots. The peak of
            the blooming season usually takes place around early May.</p>

          country, has been brewed in Sapporo since 1877.
          
          The Sapporo Beer Museum (サッポロビール博物館, Sapporo Beer Hakubutsukan) was opened in 1987 in a former brewery from the Meiji
          Period. The museum introduces the history of beer in Japan and the process of beer making. After the exhibitions, beer
          tastings are available at a small fee. Alternatively, paid tours are held in Japanese that include a tasting session at
          the end.</p>

          <p>The Kanto Matsuri (竿燈まつり, "pole lantern festival") is a Tanabata related celebration in Akita City, held every year from
            August 3 to 6. The highlight of the festival is an impressive display of skill in which performers balance kanto (long
            bamboo poles) with arrays of paper lanterns attached to the end. The Kanto Matsuri together with Aomori's Nebuta
            Festival and Sendai's Tanabata makes up the three great festivals of the Tohoku Region.
            
            The kanto poles come in different sizes with the largest measuring 12 meters, weighing 50 kilograms and carrying as many
            as 46 paper lanterns, lit by real candles. To the sound of drums, flutes and onlookers chanting "dokkoisho, dokkoisho",
            each kanto is hoisted up by a single performer who balance them on end using various techniques. The performers change
            every few minutes and gradually add extensions to the pole until the kanto are at their maximum height.</p>

            when, according to Chinese legend, the two stars Altair and Vega cross paths. Due to differences between the lunar
            calendar and the solar calendar, modern tanabata festivals take place either in July or August.
            
            The Sendai Tanabata Matsuri (仙台七夕まつり), held every year on August 6-8, is one of the largest and most famous tanabata
            celebrations in Japan.
            
            While festivities take place throughout Downtown Sendai, the festival's main feature are thousands of colorful streamers
            that decorate the city's shopping arcades, which come to resemble brightly colored forests. Each set of 3-5 meter long
            streamers is handcrafted by local shops, schools and community groups out of washi paper and bamboo. They are then hung
            from ten meter long bamboo poles along the arcades.</p>

          <h1>Three Great Noodles of Morioka</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/threegreatramen.jpg'>
          <p>The "Three Great Noodles of Morioka" are Wanko Soba, Reimen and Jajamen.
      
          Each serving of Wanko Soba contains roughly a mouthful of soba noodles, and the server
          will constantly keep topping up your empty bowl with more noodles until you indicate that you have had enough. The first
          bowl is eaten plain to taste the flavor, and toppings can be added from the second bowl.

          Morioka Reimen, as it is more popularly known outside of Morioka, was originally a Korean noodle dish. The
          noodles are made of potato starch and flour. The broth is chilled and the dish has
          toppings like sliced meat, kimchi, a slice of fruit (usually pear, apple or watermelon), half a hard boiled egg, and
          cucumbers.

          Jajamen has its origins in Chinese Zhajiangmian. It is now a variant of udon, are served dry with a scoop of meat miso, 
          a handful of sliced green onions and sliced cucumbers, with ginger on the side. Mix the miso and noodles evenly before adding vinegar, 
          chili oil or garlic to taste. After finishing the noodles, it is common to ask for "chitantan".

            Hirosaki developed around its castle, Hirosaki Castle. Several thousand cherry trees are planted around the castle
            grounds, which become one of Japan's most spectacular cherry blossom spots typically from late April to early May.

            Apart from the loss of its castle, Kakunodate remains remarkably unchanged since its founding in 1620. The town was
            built with two distinct areas, the samurai district and the merchant district. Once home to 80 families, the samurai
            district still has some of the best examples of samurai architecture in all of Japan.
            
            Kakunodate is also well known as the location of one of the Tohoku Region's most popular cherry blossom spots. Around
            late April and early May, large crowds of people come to see Kakunodate's special combination of pink blossoms and

            Masamune was the first in a long line of Date lords to rule over Sendai from Aoba Castle. His son and grandson, Date
            Tadamune and Date Tsunamune, are entombed in nearby mausoleums, while other descendants are laid to rest in less
            elaborate graves and tombs.
            
            Zuihoden was designed in the ornate style of the Momoyama Period. It features intricate woodwork and a rich variety of
            vivid colors. Masamune's son and grandson are entombed in smaller mausoleums designed in the same style.
            Massive cedar trees surround the paths in the area, and are meant to symbolize the long history of the Date clan.</p>

          ruled Japan for over 250 years until 1868. Ieyasu is enshrined at Toshogu as the deity Tosho Daigongen, "Great Deity of
          the East Shining Light".
          
          The lavishly decorated shrine complex consists of more than a dozen buildings set in a beautiful forest. Countless wood
          carvings and large amounts of gold leaf were used to decorate the buildings in a way not seen elsewhere in Japan, where
          simplicity has been traditionally stressed in shrine architecture. Visitors may note that Toshogu contains both Shinto
          and Buddhist elements. It was common for places of worship to contain elements of both religions until the Meiji Period
          when Shinto was deliberately separated from Buddhism. Across the country, Buddhist elements were removed from shrines
          and vice versa, but at Toshogu the two religions were so intermingled that the separation was not carried out

            The statue was cast in 1252 and originally located inside a large temple hall. However, the temple buildings were
            destroyed multiple times by typhoons and a tsunami in the 14th and 15th centuries. So, since the late 15th century, the

          from the Edo Period (1603-1867) and allows us to imagine the streets from past centuries. Thereby, Kawagoe became known
          as "Little Edo".
          
          During the Edo Period, Kawagoe prospered as a supplier of commodities to Tokyo (then named Edo). As Kawagoe was an
          important city to the capital for trade and strategic purposes, the shogun installed some of their most loyal men as
          lords of Kawagoe Castle. Close ties ensued between the two cities and over the years, Kawagoe inherited many aspects of
          the Edo culture and architecture.
          
          One of the most important temples in the Greater Tokyo area, Kitain Temple, is Kawagoe's other main attraction. It is

          Goddess hid herself in a cave in present day Takachiho on Kyushu after her brother had misbehaved, thereby bringing
          darkness to the world.
          
          In order to get the sunlight back, the other deities tried to lure the Sun Goddess out of the cave by performing
          spectacular dance performances in front of it. As the Sun Goddess took a peek out, one of the deities grabbed the cave's
          stone door and threw it away to prevent her from hiding again. The stone door flew all the way to Togakushi in Nagano

          on the Noto Peninsula before its head functions were transferred to Yokohama).
          
          The sizable temple complex consists of over 70 buildings and structures which are connected to each other by covered

          "hirajiro" - a castle built on plains rather than on a hill or mountain. Matsumoto Castle is unique for having both a
          secondary donjon and a turret adjoined to its main keep. The castle structures, in combination with their characteristic
          black wainscoting, give off an air of grandeur and poise.
          
          Matsumotojo's main castle keep and its smaller, second donjon were built from 1592 to 1614. Both these structures were
          well-fortified as peace was not yet fully achieved at the time. In 1635, when military threats had ceased, a third,
          barely defended turret and another for moon viewing were added to the castle.

          <p>Kenrokuen (兼六園) in Kanazawa is justifiably classified as one of Japan's "three most beautiful landscape gardens"
          alongside Mito's Kairakuen and Okayama's Korakuen. The spacious grounds used to be the outer garden of Kanazawa Castle
          and were constructed by the ruling Maeda family over a period of nearly two centuries. Opened to the public in 1871,
          Kenrokuen features a variety of flowering trees which provide the garden with a different look for each season.

          The name Kenrokuen literally means "Garden of the Six Sublimities", referring to spaciousness, seclusion, artificiality,
          antiquity, abundant water and broad views, which according to Chinese landscape theory are the six essential attributes
          that make up a perfect garden. A stroll around Kenrokuen will help with understanding this landscape theory as the
          grounds are teeming with water features, bridges, teahouses, trees, flowers, stones, viewpoints and hidden nooks to
          discover.</p>

          <h1>Mount Fuji</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/chubu-MTFUJI1219.jpg'>
          <p>Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan) is with 3776 meters Japan's highest mountain. It is not surprising that the nearly perfectly
            shaped volcano has been worshiped as a sacred mountain and experienced big popularity among artists and common people
            throughout the centuries.
            
            Mount Fuji is an active volcano, which most recently erupted in 1707. It stands on the border between Yamanashi and
            Shizuoka prefectures and can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama on clear days.
            
            However, that clouds and poor visibility often block the view of Mount Fuji, and you have to consider yourself
            lucky if you get a clear view of the mountain. Visibility tends to be better during the colder seasons of the year than
            in summer, and in the early morning and late evening hours than during the middle of the day.
            
            If you want to enjoy Mount Fuji at a more leisurely pace and from a nice natural surrounding, you should head to the
            Fuji Five Lake (Fujigoko) region at the northern foot of the mountain, or to Hakone, a nearby hot spring resort. Mount
            Fuji is officially open for climbing during July and August via several routes.

          <h1>Kobe Beef</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/kansai-kobe.jpg'>
          <p>Kobe Beef is a prized Japanese delicacy and probably the most widely-known regional specialty food in Japan. It is one
          of several breeds of Wagyu.
          
          Kobe Beef is distinguished as a tender, flavorful meat that is well marbled with fat. It is produced from pedigreed
          Tajima breed cattle which were born and slaughtered in Hyogo Prefecture. Despite popular rumor, the cows are not usually
          fed beer or massaged with sake. Once slaughtered, the meat must pass a series of requirements and only the highest
          grades of meat with exceptionally high levels of fat marbling earn the Kobe Beef label, which is a strictly-guarded
          trademark.
          
          Kobe Beef is usually served as steaks, shabu shabu (thin slices of meat quickly boiled in a broth) or sukiyaki (meat
          slices simmered in a hot pot). One of the best ways to enjoy Kobe Beef is at a teppanyaki restaurant, where a chef
          grills the meat on an iron plate in front of his guests.</p>

          <p>Kinkakuji (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion) is a Zen temple in northern Kyoto whose top two floors are completely covered in gold
            leaf. Formally known as Rokuonji, the temple was the retirement villa of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and according
            to his will it became a Zen temple of the Rinzai sect after his death in 1408. Kinkakuji was the inspiration for the
            similarly named Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion), built by Yoshimitsu's grandson, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, on the other side of
            the city a few decades later.
            
            Kinkakuji is an impressive structure built overlooking a large pond, and is the only building left of Yoshimitsu's
            former retirement complex. It has burned down numerous times throughout its history including twice during the Onin War,
            a civil war that destroyed much of Kyoto; and once again more recently in 1950 when it was set on fire by a fanatic
            monk. The present structure was rebuilt in 1955.</p>

          <p>Kiyomizudera (清水寺, literally "Pure Water Temple") is one of the most celebrated temples of Japan. It was founded in 780
            on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in the wooded hills east of Kyoto, and derives its name from the fall's pure waters.
            The temple was originally associated with the Hosso sect, one of the oldest schools within Japanese Buddhism, but formed
            its own Kita Hosso sect in 1965. In 1994, the temple was added to the list of UNESCO world heritage sites.
            
            Kiyomizudera is best known for its wooden stage that juts out from its main hall, 13 meters above the hillside below.
            The stage affords visitors a nice view of the numerous cherry and maple trees below that erupt in a sea of color in
            spring and fall, as well as of the city of Kyoto in the distance. The main hall, which together with the stage was built
            without the use of nails, houses the temple's primary object of worship, a small statue of the eleven faced, thousand
            armed Kannon.</p>

            With half a million inhabitants, Himeji is the second largest city of Hyogo Prefecture after Kobe. It can be reached in

          <p>Gion (祇園) is Kyoto's most famous geisha district, located around Shijo Avenue between Yasaka Shrine in the east and the
            Kamo River in the west. It is filled with shops, restaurants and ochaya (teahouses), where geiko (Kyoto dialect for
            geisha) and maiko (geiko apprentices) entertain.
            
            Gion attracts tourists with its high concentration of traditional wooden machiya merchant houses. Due to the fact that
            property taxes were formerly based upon street frontage, the houses were built with narrow facades only five to six
            meters wide, but extend up to twenty meters in from the street.

          historic districts. It is a great place to experience traditional old Kyoto, especially between Kiyomizudera and Yasaka
          Shrine, where the narrow lanes, wooden buildings and traditional merchant shops invoke a feeling of the old capital
          city. Recent renovations to remove telephone poles and repave the streets have further improved the traditional feel of
          the district.
          
          The streets in Higashiyama are lined by small shops, cafes and restaurants which have been catering to tourists and
          pilgrims for centuries. These businesses retain their traditional design, although many have been renovated through the
          years, and they continue to serve customers today, selling local specialties such as Kiyomizu-yaki pottery, sweets,

          <p>Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社, Fushimi Inari Taisha) is an important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for
            its thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead
            into the wooded forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine grounds.
            
            Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes
            are thought to be Inari's messengers, resulting in many fox statues across the shrine grounds. Fushimi Inari Shrine has

          <p>Mount Yoshino (吉野山, Yoshinoyama), in Nara Prefecture, has been Japan's most famous cherry blossom viewing spot for many
            centuries. It is said that the first trees were planted along its slopes more than 1300 years ago, and today the
            mountain is covered by approximately 30,000 cherry trees of many different varieties, especially of the Yamazakura
            variety.
            
            Rather than a free standing mountain, Yoshinoyama is a north-facing mountain slope. It is divided into four areas: the
            Shimo Senbon (lower 1000 trees) at the base of the mountain, Naka Senbon (middle 1000 trees), Kami Senbon (upper 1000
            trees) and Oku Senbon (inner 1000 trees) at the top of the mountain. Visitors can enjoy the cherry trees as they ascend
            the mountain, passing Yoshino's touristy town with its various temples and shrines, and enjoying hanami in the parks and
            viewpoints along the way.

          this temple requires a reservation made well in advance.
          
          Kokedera means Moss Temple, referring to the temple garden's estimated 120 different varieties of moss. Outside of
          winter, visitors to the temple can walk through this spectacular garden, which has strongly influenced subsequent
          Japanese garden design.
          
          Kokedera was originally the site of Prince Shotoku's villa before becoming a temple in the Nara Period. In 1339, the
          temple was renovated and converted into a Zen temple under the priest Muso Soseki. Muso is also credited with creating

          imported into Japan from Korea in the early 1600s. Hagiyaki flourished during the Edo Period (1603-1867) and was highly
          prized as tea wares for the tea ceremony.
          
          The color of Hagiyaki Pottery changes over time with use, as tea residuals enter the miniscule openings on its surface.
          This characteristic is highly appreciated by tea enthusiasts. Hagiyaki Pottery remains popular to this day. Many shops

          one of Japan's most important shrines. There are no records of exactly when Izumo Taisha was built, but it is often
          considered the oldest shrine in Japan, being already in existence in the early 700s as revealed by the nation's oldest
          chronicles.
          
          Izumo used to be ruled by a powerful clan in pre-historic times, and the region plays a central role in Japan's creation
          mythology. The main deity (kami) enshrined at Izumo Taisha is Okuninushi no Okami. According to the creation myths,
          Okuninushi was the creator of the land of Japan and the ruler of Izumo. He also became known as the deity of good

          Japanese, thanks to its star attraction. The shrine is known worldwide for its iconic "floating" torii gate.
          
          The shrine and its torii gate are unique for being built over water, seemingly floating in the sea during high tide. The
          shrine complex consists of multiple buildings, including a prayer hall, a main hall and a noh theater stage, which are

          distribution center. In fact, the name "Kurashiki" can be roughly translated as "town of storehouses" in reference to
          the rice storehouses.
          
          Many of Kurashiki's former storehouses have been converted into museums, boutiques and cafes. The Ohara Museum is the

          walking paths are in stark contrast to the surrounding downtown area.
          
          Before the bomb, the area of what is now the Peace Park was the political and commercial heart of the city. For this
          reason, it was chosen as the pilot's target. Four years to the day after the bomb was dropped, it was decided that the

          center of a city as opposed to hilltop and mountaintop castles. Its main keep is five stories tall, and its grounds are
          surrounded by a moat. Also within the castle's precincts are a shrine, some ruins and a few reconstructed buildings of
          the Ninomaru (second circle of defense).
          
          Hiroshima developed as a castle town, whereby the castle was both the physical and economical center of the city. Built
          in 1589 by the powerful feudal lord Mori Terumoto, Hiroshima Castle was an important seat of power in Western Japan.
          While it was spared the demolishment that many other castles met during the Meiji Restoration, like the rest of the
          city, Hiroshima Castle was destroyed by the atomic bomb in 1945.

          Honshu to the island of Shikoku, passing over six small islands in the Seto Inland Sea. It is also known as the
          Nishiseto Expressway. The Shimanami Kaido is the only one traversable by foot or bicycle.
          
          The Shimanami Kaido begins on Honshu in Onomichi City. It then leads across the six islands of Mukaishima, Innoshima,
          Ikuchijima, Omishima, Hakatajima and Oshima, before terminating on Shikoku in Imabari City. Along the way, 
          travelers can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Seto Inland Sea and the islands' small towns.

          Cycling is a popular means of experiencing the Shimanami Kaido. The bicycle route is well marked and maintained, and
          diverges from the expressway on the islands. The ramps leading up to the bridges were built at small inclines with
          cyclists in mind. At about 70 kilometers, the bike route is a bit longer than the toll road, but it can be comfortably completed in a day by intermediate cyclists.

          <img src='./src/Images/shikoku-awa-odori-dance.jpg'>
          <p>Tokushima City's Awa Odori (阿波おどり) is the most famous of many dance festivals held across Japan during the Obon season
          in mid August. Awa is the former name for Tokushima Prefecture while Odori means dance.
          
          Between August 12 and 15, spectators and dancers come to Tokushima in the thousands to see this "Fool's Dance" whose
          origins date back 400 years. This nickname comes from the lyrics to a common dance song, which translates as follows:
          "Fools dance and fools watch, if both are fools, you might as well dance".</p>

          <h1>Kochi Castle</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/shikoku-kochi.jpg'>
          <p>Kochi Castle (高知城, Kōchijō) is one of just twelve Japanese castles to have survived the fires, wars and other
          catastrophes of the post feudal age. It was first constructed between 1601 and 1611, but most of its main buildings date
          from 1748 when they were reconstructed after a fire.
          
          The castle used to be the seat of the Yamauchi lords, who ruled over the surrounding region, then known as Tosa, during
          the Edo Period. The castle buildings have since been designated "important cultural properties", and now house local
          treasures and historical objects.
          
          A unique feature of Kochi's castle is that its main tower (donjon) was not only used for military purposes, but also as
          a residence. In most other castles, the lords usually resided in separate palace buildings rather than in the castle
          keep. The castle's wooden interior maintains the appearance of it Edo Period origins, and the lookout point from the
          castle tower's top floor offers nice view of downtown.</p>

          <h1>Matsuyama Castle</h1>
          <img src='./src/Images/shikoku-matsuyamajo1.jpg'>
          <p>Matsuyama Castle (松山城, Matsuyamajō) is one of Japan's twelve "original castles", i.e. castles which have survived the
          post-feudal era since 1868 intact. It is also one of the most complex and interesting castles in the country. It is
          located on Mount Katsuyama, a steep hill in the city center that provides visitors with a bird's eye view of Matsuyama
          and the Seto Inland Sea. There are about 200 cherry trees on the castle grounds, making this a lovely cherry blossom
          spot typically around late March to early April each year.
          
          Matsuyama Castle was constructed between 1602 and 1628. In 1635, the castle got assigned to a branch of the Matsudaira
          family, relatives of the nation ruling Tokugawa, and it remained in their hands until the end of the feudal era. The
          current three storied castle tower was constructed in 1820 after the original five storied one had been destroyed by
          lightning.

          <p>Marugame Castle (丸亀城, Marugamejō), also known as Kameyama Castle, is a hilltop castle in Marugame City. Situated high up
          on steep stone walls, the castle has a commanding view of the city below and overlooks one of the narrowest parts of the
          Seto Inland Sea, a feature which afforded it control over the main shipping lanes of the region. Marugame Castle is one
          of only twelve castles remaining in Japan that have survived the post feudal ages (since 1868) with their keep buildings
          intact.
          
          Marugame Castle was originally constructed from 1597 to 1602 by Ikoma Chikamasa, the feudal lord who also built Tamamo
          Castle in nearby Takamatsu. However, due to a new policy by the shogun that limited the number of castles per province
          to just one, Marugame Castle was torn down again just 13 years after its completion. The castle was rebuilt in 1660
          after the province had been split into two. Over the centuries many of the castle buildings were destroyed by fires, and
          now only the original keep and several of the castle gates remain.</p>

          <p>The Iya Valley (祖谷渓, Iyakei) is a remote, mountainous valley in western Tokushima Prefecture. Located deep in the heart
          of Shikoku Island, the secluded valley is characterized by steep mountain slopes and deep rocky gorges which were
          traditionally crossed by vine bridges. Three of the vine bridges, Iya Kazurabashi and the Oku-Iya Kazurabashi bridges,
          are maintained to this day and remain some of the most popular attractions of the area. Iya is also well known for its
          hot springs and outdoor activities.
          
          Due to its remoteness, the valley has served as a refuge for members of the Taira Clan (also known as Heike) who escaped
          to the region after losing the Gempei War (1180-1185) at the end of the Heian Period. Their descendants can still be
          found hundreds of years later around the Iya Valley and in other remote regions of Japan such as Shirakawago,
          Yunishigawa, and the Noto Peninsula.</p>

          <p>Naoshima (直島) is an island in the Seto Inland Sea that is known for its modern art museums, architecture and sculptures.
          Part of Kagawa Prefecture, the island with its Mediterranean atmosphere, sandy beaches and sunny weather, combined with
          a laid back, rural feel is a relaxing getaway from Japan's large urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka.
          
          Much of Naoshima's art was installed by the Benesse Corporation, which oversees art museums, installations and
          sculptures both on Naoshima and on neighboring islands. Benesse's museums were designed by the well known Japanese
          architect Ando Tadao and include the Chichu Art Museum, Lee Ufan Museum and all the buildings of the Benesse House. In
          addition, Naoshima's municipal buildings and schools were designed by the modern architect Ishii Kazuhiro. The island
          serves as a main venue of the Setouchi Triennale art festival.

          <p>Ritsurin Koen (栗林公園) is a landscape garden in Takamatsu City, built by the local feudal lords during the early Edo
          Period. Considered one of the best gardens in Japan, it is often suggested that Ritsurin Koen deserves a spot on the
          list of the "three most beautiful gardens of Japan" alongside Kanazawa's Kenrokuen, Mito's Kairakuen, and Okayama's
          Korakuen.
          
          The spacious park features many ponds, hills, historic trees and beautiful pavilions divided into a Japanese style
          garden in the south and western style garden in the north. The gardens are set in front of wooded Mt. Shiun which serves
          as a wonderful background and great example of borrowed scenery.</p>

          <img src='./src/Images/kyushu-kurokawa-onsen.jpg'>
          <p>Kurokawa Onsen (黒川温泉) is one of Japan's most attractive hot spring towns, located in the middle of Kyushu about 20
          kilometers north of Mount Aso. Well coordinated efforts by the town to maintain a pleasant, traditional atmosphere have
          kept Kurokawa free of the massive concrete hotels, neon advertisements and loud colors that are encountered in many of
          Japan's other resort towns.
          
          Instead, Kurokawa's townscape is dominated by natural colors and materials, wooden buildings, earthen walls, stone
          stairs and a river flowing through. The town center, located in a forested valley, is compact and easily explored on
          foot, except for a few ryokan which are located less centrally.
          
          The town's lanes are lined by ryokan, public bath houses, attractive shops and cafes, a small shrine and bridges that
          lead over the river directly to ryokan entrances. A walk through town is particularly enjoyable in yukata and geta
          sandals provided by one's ryokan. An information center, where maps and other information can be obtained, is also found
          in the town center.</p>

          <img src='./src/Images/kyushu-beppu-onsen.jpg'>
          <p>Beppu is one of the most famous hot spring resorts in Japan. The city is blessed by as many as eight different springs,
          named Beppu Onsen, Kannawa Onsen, Myoban Onsen, Kankaiji Onsen, Hamawaki Onsen, Kamegawa Onsen, Horita Onsen and
          Shibaseki Onsen, each featuring public baths and ryokan with bathing facilities. Together they produce more hot spring
          water than any other onsen resort in the country.
          
          What sets Beppu apart from other onsen resorts is not only its abundance of thermal waters, but also the wide range of
          bath types that can be enjoyed there. Aside from conventional hot water baths, Beppu offers sand baths where bathers are
          buried in naturally heated sand, steam baths that are heated by the steam of a hot spring, and mud baths which are
          basically muddy hot water baths.

          <p>Fukuoka's open air food stands (屋台, Yatai) are possibly the city's best known symbol. Yatai can generally seat about
          seven or eight people and provide an atmospheric outdoor environment to enjoy various foods. 
          There are dozens of yatai scattered across Fukuoka, but the best place to find them is on the southern end
          of Nakasu Island.
          
          Typical dishes enjoyed at yatai are grilled chicken skewers (yakitori), hot pot (oden) and most famously Hakata Ramen, a
          local noodle dish featuring relatively thin ramen noodles in a pork bone based soup (tonkotsu). Various alcoholic drinks
          are also available, and help make the yatai a great place to get in touch with the locals, although many of the "locals"
          happen to be Japanese tourists visiting Fukuoka from other parts of Japan.
          
          Yatai are typically open from around 6pm to around 2am, except when the weather is very bad. Many stands close one day
          of the week. The closure day varies from stand to stand, but is often Sunday. There can be waiting times for popular
          stands, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.

          preserved samurai district with houses and gardens that date back about 250 years. Chiran's isolated location at the
          southern end of Kyushu has allowed the district to keep much of its historical character intact.
          
          The preserved samurai district consists of a 700 meter long street within downtown Chiran that runs parallel to the main
          thoroughfare. The street itself is very attractive, with the rock walls and hedges of residences and the forested
          hillsides in the distance. Unlike some other samurai districts, it is also free of telephone poles and parked cars that
          would detract from the historic atmosphere.</p>

            Only a few structures have survived the centuries since the castle's construction in 1607 intact. The castle keep and
            most other buildings are modern reconstructions, but the reconstructions are mostly of a high quality and new buildings
            are continually being added. With about 800 cherry trees, the castle becomes a popular cherry blossom spot usually in

          August 9, 1945, which destroyed a significant portion of the city and killed tens of thousands of inhabitants. The
          complex is comprised of two parks and a memorial museum.
          
          In the center of the complex is the Hypocenter Park with a simple, black monolith that marks the explosion's epicenter.
          Not far from it stands a damaged pillar of the former Urakami Cathedral which was destroyed in the blast. Furthermore,
          there is an area that allows visitors to take a look at a layer of soil below the park's surface where broken roof
          tiles, bricks and pieces of glass remain from the explosion.

          cliffs lining the gorge are made of slow forming volcanic basalt columns which resemble the scales of a dragon where the
          stone twisted and flowed as it formed.
          
          Partway along the gorge is the 17 meter high Minainotaki waterfall cascading down to the river below, and it is truly

            by an extensive cedar forest that contains some of Japan's oldest living trees. Trees more than 1000 years old are
            affectionately called yakusugi (a combination of Yakushima and sugi, the Japanese word for cedar), the most ancient of
            which may be over 7000 years old.
                
            As a subtropical island with nearly 2000 meter high mountains, Yakushima attracts a lot of rainfall around the year,
            with a local saying claiming that it rains "35 days a month". While that may be an exaggeration, there is some rain
            almost on a daily basis, especially in the mountainous interior, although the rain can also be light and limited to
            short periods of time. In higher elevations the precipitation falls as snow during the winter months.</p>
