          <p>The Sapporo Snow Festival (さっぽろ雪まつり, Sapporo Yuki Matsuri) is held during one week every February in Hokkaido's capital
            Sapporo. It is one of Japan's most popular winter events.
            
            The Sapporo Snow Festival was started in 1950, when high school students built a few snow statues in Odori Park. It has
            since developed into a large, commercialized event, featuring spectacular snow and ice sculptures and attracting more
            than two million visitors from Japan and across the world.
            
            The snow festival is staged on three sites: the Odori Site, Susukino Site and Tsu Dome Site.</p>

            just outside of Sapporo's Central Wholesale Market. One of the city's largest public markets, the Curb Market
            specializes in Hokkaido seafood such as crab, sea urchin, salmon roe, squid and scallops, and local produce such as
            corn, melons and potatoes when in season.
            
            The market's shops cater to both locals and tourists alike, and have a good selection at reasonable prices. Like other
            seafood markets around Japan, an excellent way to experience the market's offerings is to have a meal of fresh local
            seafood served over rice (domburi) at one of the local restaurants.</p>

            The small village consists of only about a dozen buildings, wooden lodges, a beautiful youth hostel and two or three
            large hotels. Shopping and dining opportunities are limited to the hotels and the ropeway station. For weather

            Hokkaido's development was carried out on a large scale. There are four different sections: a town, fishing village,

          <p>Fort Goryokaku (五稜郭, Goryōkaku) is a massive, star shaped, Western style citadel, which was built in the last years of
            the Edo Period for the defense of Hakodate against the imperialist threat posed by the Western powers. A few years
            later, the fort became the site of a civil war between an army of the shogunate and the superior troops of the newly
            established Meiji government.
            
            After the fort had lost its military importance, it was eventually turned into a public park in the 1910s. Over one
            thousand cherry trees were planted along its moats, making it one of Hokkaido's best cherry blossom spots. The peak of
            the blooming season usually takes place around early May.</p>

            The Sapporo Beer Museum (サッポロビール博物館, Sapporo Beer Hakubutsukan) was opened in 1987 in a former brewery from the Meiji
            Period. The museum introduces the history of beer in Japan and the process of beer making. After the exhibitions, beer
            tastings are available at a small fee. Alternatively, paid tours are held in Japanese that include a tasting session at
            the end.</p>

          <p>The Kanto Matsuri (竿燈まつり, "pole lantern festival") is a Tanabata related celebration in Akita City, held every year from
            August 3 to 6. The highlight of the festival is an impressive display of skill in which performers balance kanto (long
            bamboo poles) with arrays of paper lanterns attached to the end. The Kanto Matsuri together with Aomori's Nebuta
            Festival and Sendai's Tanabata makes up the three great festivals of the Tohoku Region.
            
            The kanto poles come in different sizes with the largest measuring 12 meters, weighing 50 kilograms and carrying as many
            as 46 paper lanterns, lit by real candles. To the sound of drums, flutes and onlookers chanting "dokkoisho, dokkoisho",
            each kanto is hoisted up by a single performer who balance them on end using various techniques. The performers change
            every few minutes and gradually add extensions to the pole until the kanto are at their maximum height.</p>

            when, according to Chinese legend, the two stars Altair and Vega cross paths. Due to differences between the lunar
            calendar and the solar calendar, modern tanabata festivals take place either in July or August.
            
            The Sendai Tanabata Matsuri (仙台七夕まつり), held every year on August 6-8, is one of the largest and most famous tanabata
            celebrations in Japan. Together, with Akita's Kanto Matsuri and Aomori's Nebuta Matsuri, it makes up the Tohoku Sandai
            Matsuri (Three Great Festivals of the Tohoku Region).
            
            While festivities take place throughout Downtown Sendai, the festival's main feature are thousands of colorful streamers
            that decorate the city's shopping arcades, which come to resemble brightly colored forests. Each set of 3-5 meter long
            streamers is handcrafted by local shops, schools and community groups out of washi paper and bamboo. They are then hung
            from ten meter long bamboo poles along the arcades.</p>

            <h1>Gyutan</h1>
            <img src='../src/Images/sendai-gyutan.jpg'>
            <p>Sendai is the original home of gyutan (牛タン, gyūtan), a dish consisting of pieces of thinly sliced beef tongue, cooked
              over a charcoal grill. Besides the standard version of grilled tongue and pickled vegetables seen above, gyutan is also
              popular in donburi form, as a curry, or in a beef stew.
              
              The dish originated fairly recently in 1948 when a yakitori restaurant owner in Sendai devoted his business to the
              preparation of beef tongue dishes. It has grown rapidly in popularity and spread throughout Japan.
              
              Common side dishes of gyutan are oxtail soup, and mugi gohan (steamed white rice with barley). In its donburi variety,
              gyutan is served over a bowl of steamed white rice, while the curry gyutan is accompanied by rice as well.
              
              The two most popular gyutan restaurant chains are Rikyu and Kisuke. Both of these chains have branches on Gyutan Dori
              (gyutan street) on third floor of Sendai Station. The restaurants of Gyutan Dori open their doors at 10:00 while most of
              the city branch gyutan chains open for lunch around 11:00. Menus generally range in price from about 1000 yen to about
              2000 yen.</p>

            <p>During the Edo Period, Hirosaki (弘前) was the political and cultural capital of the Tsugaru Region, the western section
              of present day Aomori Prefecture. The city remains one of the culturally richest cities in the northern Tohoku Region.
              
              Hirosaki developed around its castle, Hirosaki Castle. Several thousand cherry trees are planted around the castle
              grounds, which become one of Japan's most spectacular cherry blossom spots typically from late April to early May.

              Apart from the loss of its castle, Kakunodate remains remarkably unchanged since its founding in 1620. The town was
              built with two distinct areas, the samurai district and the merchant district. Once home to 80 families, the samurai
              district still has some of the best examples of samurai architecture in all of Japan.
              
              Kakunodate is also well known as the location of one of the Tohoku Region's most popular cherry blossom spots. Around
              late April and early May, large crowds of people come to see Kakunodate's special combination of pink blossoms and

              Masamune was the first in a long line of Date lords to rule over Sendai from Aoba Castle. His son and grandson, Date
              Tadamune and Date Tsunamune, are entombed in nearby mausoleums, while other descendants are laid to rest in less
              elaborate graves and tombs.
              
              Zuihoden was designed in the ornate style of the Momoyama Period. It features intricate woodwork and a rich variety of
              vivid colors. Masamune's son and grandson are entombed in smaller mausoleums designed in the same style.
              Massive cedar trees surround the paths in the area, and are meant to symbolize the long history of the Date clan.</p>

            ruled Japan for over 250 years until 1868. Ieyasu is enshrined at Toshogu as the deity Tosho Daigongen, "Great Deity of
            the East Shining Light". Initially a relatively simple mausoleum, Toshogu was enlarged into the spectacular complex seen
            today by Ieyasu's grandson Iemitsu during the first half of the 1600s.
            
            The lavishly decorated shrine complex consists of more than a dozen buildings set in a beautiful forest. Countless wood
            carvings and large amounts of gold leaf were used to decorate the buildings in a way not seen elsewhere in Japan, where
            simplicity has been traditionally stressed in shrine architecture. Visitors may note that Toshogu contains both Shinto
            and Buddhist elements. It was common for places of worship to contain elements of both religions until the Meiji Period
            when Shinto was deliberately separated from Buddhism. Across the country, Buddhist elements were removed from shrines
            and vice versa, but at Toshogu the two religions were so intermingled that the separation was not carried out

            from the Edo Period (1603-1867) and allows us to imagine the streets from past centuries. Thereby, Kawagoe became known
            as "Little Edo".
            
            During the Edo Period, Kawagoe prospered as a supplier of commodities to Tokyo (then named Edo). As Kawagoe was an
            important city to the capital for trade and strategic purposes, the shogun installed some of their most loyal men as
            lords of Kawagoe Castle. Close ties ensued between the two cities and over the years, Kawagoe inherited many aspects of
            the Edo culture and architecture.
            
            One of the most important temples in the Greater Tokyo area, Kitain Temple, is Kawagoe's other main attraction. It is

            darkness to the world.

          secondary donjon and a turret adjoined to its main keep. The castle structures, in combination with their characteristic
          black wainscoting, give off an air of grandeur and poise.
          
          Matsumotojo's main castle keep and its smaller, second donjon were built from 1592 to 1614. Both these structures were
          well-fortified as peace was not yet fully achieved at the time. In 1635, when military threats had ceased, a third,
          barely defended turret and another for moon viewing were added to the castle.

          buildings from the Meiji Period (1868-1912). This era followed the end of Japan's feudal age, and its architecture is
          characterized by a strong influx of Western architecture.
          
          The theme park-like museum is located in Inuyama, one hour outside of Nagoya, in a vast wooded area next to Iruka Pond.
          Meiji Mura is one of the most visited open air museums in Japan. It takes at least half a day to explore the spacious
          museum grounds and cover all of its exhibits.</p>

          <h1>Kamikochi</h1>
          <img src='../src/Images/chubu-kamikochi-2-1024x767.jpg'>
          <p>Kamikochi (上高地, Kamikōchi) is a popular resort in the Northern Japan Alps of Nagano Prefecture, offering some of Japan's
            most spectacular mountain scenery. It is open from mid/late April until November 15 and shuts down during winter. In
            2021, Kamikochi is scheduled to be open from April 17 to November 15.
            
            Kamikochi is a roughly 15 kilometer long plateau in the Azusa River Valley, about 1500 meters above sea level. It is
            surrounded by tall mountains, including Nishihotakadake (2909 m), Okuhotakadake (3190 m), Maehotakadake (3090 m) and the
            active volcano Yakedake (2455 m).
            
            Part of the Chubu Sangaku National Park, Kamikochi has only been moderately developed with half a dozen hotels, a few
            souvenir shops, mountain huts and hiking trails. Private cars are banned from Kamikochi, and access is only possible by
            bus or taxi.

          <h1>Kenrokuen Garden</h1>
          <img src='../src/Images/chubu-kenrokuen.jpg'>
          <p>Kenrokuen (兼六園) in Kanazawa is justifiably classified as one of Japan's "three most beautiful landscape gardens"
          alongside Mito's Kairakuen and Okayama's Korakuen. The spacious grounds used to be the outer garden of Kanazawa Castle
          and were constructed by the ruling Maeda family over a period of nearly two centuries. Opened to the public in 1871,
          Kenrokuen features a variety of flowering trees which provide the garden with a different look for each season.

          The name Kenrokuen literally means "Garden of the Six Sublimities", referring to spaciousness, seclusion, artificiality,
          antiquity, abundant water and broad views, which according to Chinese landscape theory are the six essential attributes
          that make up a perfect garden. A stroll around Kenrokuen will help with understanding this landscape theory as the
          grounds are teeming with water features, bridges, teahouses, trees, flowers, stones, viewpoints and hidden nooks to
          discover.</p>

          <h1>Mount Fuji</h1>
          <img src='../src/Images/chubu-MTFUJI1219.jpg'>
          <p>Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan) is with 3776 meters Japan's highest mountain. It is not surprising that the nearly perfectly
            shaped volcano has been worshiped as a sacred mountain and experienced big popularity among artists and common people
            throughout the centuries.
            
            Mount Fuji is an active volcano, which most recently erupted in 1707. It stands on the border between Yamanashi and
            Shizuoka prefectures and can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama on clear days.
            
            However, that clouds and poor visibility often block the view of Mount Fuji, and you have to consider yourself
            lucky if you get a clear view of the mountain. Visibility tends to be better during the colder seasons of the year than
            in summer, and in the early morning and late evening hours than during the middle of the day.
            
            If you want to enjoy Mount Fuji at a more leisurely pace and from a nice natural surrounding, you should head to the
            Fuji Five Lake (Fujigoko) region at the northern foot of the mountain, or to Hakone, a nearby hot spring resort. Mount
            Fuji is officially open for climbing during July and August via several routes.

          <h1>Kiyomizudera</h1>
          <img src='../src/Images/'>
          <p>Kiyomizudera (清水寺, literally "Pure Water Temple") is one of the most celebrated temples of Japan. It was founded in 780
          on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in the wooded hills east of Kyoto, and derives its name from the fall's pure waters.
          The temple was originally associated with the Hosso sect, one of the oldest schools within Japanese Buddhism, but formed
          its own Kita Hosso sect in 1965. In 1994, the temple was added to the list of UNESCO world heritage sites.
          
          Kiyomizudera is best known for its wooden stage that juts out from its main hall, 13 meters above the hillside below.
          The stage affords visitors a nice view of the numerous cherry and maple trees below that erupt in a sea of color in
          spring and fall, as well as of the city of Kyoto in the distance. The main hall, which together with the stage was built
          without the use of nails, houses the temple's primary object of worship, a small statue of the eleven faced, thousand
          armed Kannon.</p>

          <h1>Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion)</h1>
          <img src='../src/Images/'>
          <p>Kinkakuji (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion) is a Zen temple in northern Kyoto whose top two floors are completely covered in gold
          leaf. Formally known as Rokuonji, the temple was the retirement villa of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and according
          to his will it became a Zen temple of the Rinzai sect after his death in 1408. Kinkakuji was the inspiration for the
          similarly named Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion), built by Yoshimitsu's grandson, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, on the other side of
          the city a few decades later.
          
          Kinkakuji is an impressive structure built overlooking a large pond, and is the only building left of Yoshimitsu's
          former retirement complex. It has burned down numerous times throughout its history including twice during the Onin War,
          a civil war that destroyed much of Kyoto; and once again more recently in 1950 when it was set on fire by a fanatic
          monk. The present structure was rebuilt in 1955.</p>

          <img src='../src/Images/'>
          <p>Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社, Fushimi Inari Taisha) is an important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for
          its thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead
          into the wooded forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine grounds.
          
          Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes
          are thought to be Inari's messengers, resulting in many fox statues across the shrine grounds. Fushimi Inari Shrine has
          ancient origins, predating the capital's move to Kyoto in 794.</p>
